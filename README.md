# CANet
Attention-guided Chained Context Aggregation for Semantic Segmentation

1)CANet is a Encode Decode based semantic segmentation model. Link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12041.pdf

2)The model use Dilated Resnet 26 as backbone network.

3)Model gains features of various spatial scales through chain-connected ladder-style information flows.

4)Here the Train_Model file contain the train code ,Test_Model contains test and Preprocessing file containe the preprocessing of data
